## Abstract

This project will be based on the game, Frogger. All eight available video/sprite cores shall be utilized for the player's frog, as well as various moving obstacle sprites and the game background. A keyboard's arrow keys will be used to control the frog's movement. The main animated sprite will be of the frog jumping. Text on the screen will display the Level / Speed at which the obstacles move, as determined by the potentiometer (XADC). If time, a new video core will be implemented: All-Star Mode, which makes it harder for the player to see where they're going due to overlaying multiple colorful distractions on the screen.
